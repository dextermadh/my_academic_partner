# my_academic_partner

This project is an Academic Assistant powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Agentic AI.
It acts like a personal study partner, retrieving knowledge from a vector database and combining it with student-styled examples to produce academic answers that are both accurate and aligned with the learnerâ€™s style.

You can run the notebook files and get a demo output, I am currently working on the full project
