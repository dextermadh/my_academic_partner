# my_academic_partner

This project is an Academic Assistant powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
It retrieves relevant documents from a vector database and combines them with student-styled examples to generate personalized academic answers.

You can run the notebook files and get a demo output, I am currently working on the full project
